### **`Digital Data Craftsman`**  
`Data Engineering` | `Analytics and Visualization` | `Machine Learning`

As an engineer I design scalable data systems, transforming unstructured data 
into optimized pipelines, warehouses, and analytics-ready models. Using my knowlege
of machine learning, I am able to further enhance my data by helping create accurate
prediction models to give an additional layer of decision maker. All of the projects I
have undertake have a singular goal in mind - building ETL systems to ensure data quality
and proper data infrasture, as well as empowering people to make better decisions.
